# The Kiske field

This is the preface/teaser of a larger post about British IT, decided to split it in order to give out smaller chunks. A very important **disclaimer**: I have not been able to talk with the people involved in the story below nor check it out extensively, so please treat the story in the next section as fiction.

## Definition - first story.

More than 10 years before, [Iron Maiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden 'Iron Maiden - Wikipedia') was the biggest heavy metal band on the planet. At some point their singer, [Bruce Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson 'Bruce Dickinson - Wikipedia') decided to leave the band and pursue a solo career. The remaining members wanted to continue, but they needed first to find someone to replace the empty seat.  At that point the band decided to do an international competition in order to choose their next singer. Being in an era before MP3, people where sending recordings of themselves singing or other material mostly in cassettes and send that over. Leader of the band at that time was the legendary [Steve Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harris_%28musician%29 'Steve Harris - Wikipedia').

At about that time a hot discussion topic among genre's fans was who would be the next "Dickinson". Among the hundreds of tapes that the band received, it was [Blaze Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley 'Blaze Bailey - Wikipedia'), who was at then singing in an English niche band that almost no-one had ever heard of. Another candidate among the many, was the well known heavy metal singer and front-man [Michael Kiske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kiske 'Michael Kiske - Wikipedia'), which brings us to the next part.

Many years later, I was operating a fanzine and was working part time as a metal journalist, so I had the chance to meet Blaze Bailey for an interview a year after he had left the band. The funny thing was that when asked about the Iron Maiden years, he was stressing on how lucky he felt -even if it didn't last long- and how surprised he was. Another friend of mine had interviewed Michael Kiske.  Kiske was always doing other things, but when asked off the record (this is what I cannot prove or confirm) he said that the rumor "in the business" was that *"Steve Harris would never accept a non-Englishman to lead England's best heavy metal band, so he did an international competition in order to choose the best from his country"*.

Based on the (unconfirmed) story above we can define formally the "Kiske law":

**Choosing the best English person from a list of international candidates**

And for ease of use the lemma-definition of a "Kiske field":

**A company with hiring and promotions strategy influenced by the Kiske law (see above)**

## Another story

This is a real story, with the industry and the names of the people involved changed. It's about a friend of mine named Daniella. Daniella is one of the best account managers on her field at least in Europe. Because of her very busy schedule I lately meet her at about once per year. Two years before, she was talking to me about why she would look for changing companies "*soon*":

*"When I joined the company almost everybody on our team was from Europe's south (say [PIGS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_%28economics%29 'PIGS')), we were handling a range of client accounts and were usually working long hours. After the first two years with the company established, the decided was made to stabilize the number of clients and acquisition rate.

I found out that as old employees started leaving, in expected turnover rates, the new hires were being paid more for less amount of work. Also all the new hires are locals. This was one of the signals that I had to move on"*

Following Daniella's posts on Facebook (:-[), I saw that some months later she is head of European operations for her sector in a large multinational. The multinational though is a company based in Scandinavia. When I read her celebratory post and the subsequent ones, I couldn't help myself but wonder if the same story would possible on a UK multinational.

I have heard many stories, I also have mine. This though describes best the "Kiske effect".

## Analysis

Decided not to write about personal experiences mainly so that there would not be any personal involvement which might distort my view. Generally the following pattern has been observed, at least on the IT industry where I am active:

1. First generation foreigners are usually treated as glorified temp employees. At any given time they might get back to their country of origin.
2. As a result promoting them into mid-level management bears the risk of creating a gap (or the possibility of a domino effect if replaced by another person from the same pool).
3. This in turn affects their (our) mentality and psychology: being artificially marginalized impacts corporate loyalty; hence
4. They (we) in effect are prone to switch jobs, since there is no attachment with the "current" employer.

Some additional observations on the points above, after discussions with many and different people:

Point (1) is still the case for many cases. I strongly believe that this was true in the not so distant past, but not currently. Allow to elaborate:

As the story goes the "unspoken deal" for a foreigner i the UK, specially in London involved a short career trajectory among those lines: Study (BSc), maybe more studies (MSc), optional internship, *bang!*, permanent work for a couple of years, *bang!* or a promotion and *bang!*.

Where "*bang!*" equals return to the country of origin of course. CV would include UK experience or moreover London experience, which in many places is for some reason a salary multiplier. Something similar was also the case with people from rural Britain. It was supposed to be a temporary thing. Until one day it's not. Having recessions "bombs" exploding takes the possibility of returning out. As an example people from PIGS countries cannot return, even if they want to. So point (1) above is now not that valid. It is possible that the business world has not yet adjusted... Maybe.

Second point enhances the side-effects of point 1 - again in the past. Getting promoted
increased the perceived value on the country of origin. Being a manager "here" translates to Sr Manager "there" so a promotion can even accelerate the speed towards the *"bang!"* point.

Last points (3 and 4) are about what's happening on the other side: Imagine that you start working in a company, you do your best for a couple of years. You don't see promotion, a change in your salary or even a discussion your career. You see this happening with other people. What would you think? How would you react?

Observing a vicious circle: **Is your company in a Kiske field?**
