# Books of 2016

## 1. "Broken angels" - Richard Morgan

Richard Morgan is the only author whose books I try to read twice. I had read
"Broken angels" more than five years before and apart from a very few scenes I
remembered next to nothing. Follow up to "Altered carbon" with Takeshi Kovacs
in a planet far away from earth in a totally different adventure (no spoilers).
Tough but rewarding page turner. Wanted to read so much that I was just
devouring it, missing less details of the story than the first time and
possibly more than the third if there will ever be one.

The universe of the Kovacs trilogy is unique in it's world building although
a "proper" dystopia, Moran makes me want to be in one of it's planets for a
while. Difficult to digest the concept of "re-sleeving" but while writing these
lines my head is is still full of futuristic weapons, interstellar travel,
Marian spaceships, private armies, religious fanatics, cloak and dagger
betrayal, corporate executives and so many other things on which I will try
not to dwell so that I will not reveal any details of the plot. I really liked
the fact that it's plot is set somewhere far away from planet Earth which I
usually treat as an short-cut from building a good science fiction world,
something that many books suffer from with the previous one "Altered carbon"
of course **excluded**.

On the topic of comparing it with "Alter..." many people found this one somehow
inferior mostly because some of their favourite elements from that one are not
here. I found both books on the same level. I would really favour this one,
if I had to choose between the two, without pushing myself to do so because I
am a fan of the author. The first book had elements and a plot that appeal to a
wider audience, with the second one appealing more to people that enjoy the
specific genre be it science fiction or cyberpunk or dystopian future whatever.

Third and last of the series, "Woken furies", will have to wait for a prolonged
period of free time such as a holiday, since it's size scares me.

## 02 DO/Story/ "How to tell your story so the world listens" - Bobette Buster

Was lucky enough to listen to a speech from the book's author at the end of last year on which I could get a "How to tell..." copy for my to-read list, which I am currently cleaning up. Hope was to assist in improving my writing.

"How to tell..." is an introduction/tour to the art of story telling from a Hollywood-ish angle. Useful as I decided to use the suggested exercises and suggestions for my own writing and blog posts. Book is small in size but packed with the mechanics of story telling, flavoured with stories from the author's and her students' lives as well as from memorable films.

Might check out other books from the same series as the size/utility ratio is intriguing.

## 03 "Getting past no" - William Ury

This one was a gift that ended up on my "to read" stack, because of an interest that I had expressed in negotiation literature. I started reading it in order to look cool to the person who gave it to me, but luckily I got hooked.

In the first chapters Ury discusses on what you should never do when negotiations go south. It was essentially an enumeration on what I was doing before in the similar occasions so that grabbed my attention. Later on the book discusses it's main subject on how to drive a negotiation with a very negative opponent, following the book's terminology. How to stay calm, where I used to suck, disarm the toxicity, reframe the discussion and so forth.

Having been exposed to "Getting more", "past no" gave insights on these corner cases that do not seem to make sense, happen more often than we thing they should and offer a way to encounter them.
