title: British business relationships
---

It might seem that I am ranting or just in a bad mood when writing posts like this,
or that I do not like London/UK. On the contrary, I do, just having lived here
for some years, I've started observing some patterns that were not initially
visible. Aim is to describe them and have them available to people that are
thinking on migrating and/or starting a business here or to start a discussion.

Thesis: British IT businesses treat business relationships with specific
partners as more important than the product, business culture or basically
everything else. This reflects internal business organisations and priorities,
leaving most of them ripe from disruption from US based businesses.

Let's start with education. I've observed two elements: a business education
mono-culture and something that seems like a projection of the class system.
In detail, I've attended three business seminars while living in London from
different institutions. In two of them, the third was strictly startup oriented,
we got trained to aim for the highest margins. At one attendants were presented
with a Maslow's pyramid on which the bottom was raw materials (lowest margin),
climbing to utilities, services up to specific needs which had the highest margin.
Discussing on high margin vs high volume everybody seemd to agree that it's more
preferable to sell on high margin and build a relationship with the client.
First time that this happened, Î™ brought up businesses such as Amazon, Google,
Paypal. Where's the high margin in those. The answer of course was that I was
brining up "exceptions". Allow me to elaborate more on that later in this
article.

## Foundations

Mostly from disucussions with different people it seems that this is what most
UK based business schools and universities tend to teach. So most strategists
and executives are trained to spot the "high margin" in a business model that
they investigate or is suggested to them. Being a small enough country to
support two approaches on pretty much everything, I've stated to believe that
there is some sort of mono-culture. Anectodal all of the above, but cannot let
go that always while presenting a business plan or a product, there is always
someone in the audience asking: Can you build a customised version for "XYZ"?
If "ABC" comes and asks for "D" would you implement it only for them?

The other factor that has been observed is a projection of the class system in
the decision making process. It seems that there is a "serve the richest person
in the room" culture around. It's a delicate issue to discuss since people are
heavily opinionated about it and associate it with politics, but it sometimes
feels like an elephant in the room so it has to be brought up. There is that
tendency to try to create a cash flow creating a customised service to the
biggest brand name, an important client. For example if you are creating a
system for say retail/super markets then you'd better have Tesco, Sainsbury's or
Waitrose on board, else nobody is going to notice. I've observed more than once
a big client influencing the orientation of a product so much that at the end
it is next to impossible to sell it to someone else. Many businesses that start
as product companies, become consultancies by following this path. This brings
us to the "laws" in the next section.

### Mistrioti's laws on UK IT businesses

1. Every UK based IT business has a tendency to do a little bit of consulting.
2. Because of entropy and (1) all British IT businesses end up becoming
consultancies.

## So why exactly is this bad?

For two reasons:

* Businesses and models are not shielded from disruption
* It poisons the internal structure of the companies.

### Disruption

The question on "what's going on here?" started to manifestate on me while
talking to people in the industry but mostly while working. Some discussions
didn't make sense. Then one day while studying "Living in the UK" as part of
my citizenship application I came across this:

So we are in a country that generates whole sectors such as computing (Turing)
and web (Tim B. Lee), has access to huge amounts of capital (City) but then
capitalisation happens across the Atlantic.

One answer was in the Tanenbaum VS Alan Kay debate in the 90s, but
for some reason that doesn't seem enough. Where's the British Google, Amazon,
Paypal?

For the country as a whole it leaves all businesses open to
disruptions. For people working there especially foreigners (such as me) it
creates a glass wall barrier.

Let's talk a bit about internal structuring

For most of the places that I've observed the structuring
