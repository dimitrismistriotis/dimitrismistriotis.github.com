title: The problematic British (business) relationships
---

This is the first part of a series about British IT. Posts will range from most "generic" ones down to mostly "personal" ones. Please note that there is no attempt to be academical in nature, just what has been observed by someone who started as an outsider hence conventional wisdom was something new.

This post is about what I'd call "**consultancy mentality**" and how I believe holds back UK's IT industry and in many times kills businesses. Before publishing it a friend introduced me to the hunting "elephants vs deers vs rabbits" analogy, which is discussed before the last section.

## Two observations of British IT businesses.

1. Every UK based IT business has a tendency to do a little bit of consulting.
2. Because of entropy and (1) all British IT businesses end up becoming
consultancies.

This happens for reasons:

1. Businesses and models are not shielded from disruption, and
2. It poisons the internal structure of the companies.

In a similar approach with the other two articles on this series, I'll mix some of the first personal experiences, with the result of observations, research and discussions that they triggered. At the end I'll give my answer on the roots of the issue and why I think it's really bad.

## Facing outwards

Before migrating to UK, I had two sources of theoretical knowledge about running an IT business: The first was from University where there were many classes about micro-economics and finance since it was a financial university with a computer science department. The other source was books like "Founders at work" (LINK), mostly from Silicon Valley veterans usually about their companies early stage.

Being in London I had the chance to attend three courses/seminars about IT startups, which was my area of interest. Only one was actually about the subject (Accelerator Academy - LINK), the other two were "Starting up", something that I believed was well defined in the last 10 years. What impressed me in the two conventional ones was a presentation of a business version projection of the Marshlow pyramid of needs.

As in the original pyramid there is the need for food and shelter at the bottom, on the business version there was the accumulation of resources: mining, agriculture, oil drilling etc. Moving up we had utilities, services, with full customized solutions on the top. The higher your you are positioned as a business in the "business" pyramid, the higher are your margins. Closer to the bottom equals progressively lower margins. A question that come up was why would someone want to be in the bottom of the pyramid? Two answers where provided: No other available option, or higher sales volume on the bottom (hence the number of units sold substitutes for the lower margin). According to the narrative you always want to get "higher", which is where the highest margins are.

This approach is also projected on IT. No matter how a business is arranged it has to have a  consultancy element: It should discover very rich client(s) with very specific needs and establish a business relationship with a deterministic cash flow: serve their needs and suck their cash. A way to imagine it would be a pump that would steadily pump money from a small number of clients to the IT company.

Another element before we discuss the implications of the above further is country's size. Comparing with different countries significantly larger such as USA or China, UK's size can sustain a managerial mono-culture. For IT we know as an example that there is a different approach in IT on Silicon Valley (innovation) versus say New York (Finance) or Texas. Britain's size allows a mono-culture in managers, so there might be few places where the discussion is towards generating volume or satisfying the lower margins, or more "generic" IT.

Back to our story, I remember that while on the first startup, a mentor had told us that the fact that we were building a "generic" product, should be viewed as a good door opener that would start discussions on selling consulting services around it. Our software as a service model was just a mistake, we should " find that big client X that needs very specific features just for them". I could not but compare that with the blog posts of 37 signals who took the other route, getting out of consulting as their products were building momentum. Something didn't make sense.

Another thing that didn't make sense was that although major advancements in computer science were happening from Britons such as Alan Turing or Tim Burners Lee, their commercialization and profit was generated elsewhere. Why is this the case? I tend to believe it's because of the above...

I tend to believe that the popular narrative defies the specifics of software as a concept as well as the theory of margins explained in Kristensen's "Innovators Dilemma" (LINK). Beginning from the latter it is easier to disposition companies placed in the higher margin disrupting from the lower ones. Reason has to do with economies of scale which can create strides in quality. This is accelerated on the software field where the additional unit has the margin cost of zero: I don't think that an extra 1 million searches would cost Google anything significant. It becomes even more brutal on the era of web and mobile applications, because of the absence of physical media. As an illustrative example, let's consider selling books. Suppose that someone, chasing the high margins was selling something like medical school textbooks. Now suppose that another company was trying to sell to lower margins, like say computer science textbooks but was targeting on volume, which is what Amazon did. After some years Amazon would have to build a logistics network, websites that would cope with high volume of visitors etc. After some time, it would be far more easier to assemble a team of specialists and ask them to see how they could sell medical textbooks, by utilizing the existing network and resources. That's far more easier than our imaginary high margin company trying to sell other stuff in order to survive. We can think of or remember many other examples.

Ending the prolonged introduction: positioning your software company as a consultancy is something that can easily kill it. But also this seems to be the preferred option for UK businesses... Why?

## Inwards

After discussing the issues of the consulting approach towards the marketplace and competition, let's look how this affects the internal structuring of companies. Looking inwards I have observed that what is considered important is not functions that are related with the end product or service such as programming or design, or generally what's happening at the assembly line. What is considered important is satisfying the richest customer as soon as possible. Hence the spotlight is reserved for client-facing functions, with the rest being marginalized as second class citizens.

Some companies take this approach to the next level treating their whole operations as an expense. Example: We don't need to have developers in our software company, just a product owner who would know the history of the project, the rest can be outsourced. Only the "relationship" with the paying clients is necessary the rest are just expenses. Get yourself into the shoes of a developer or graphic designer or system administrator in a company like that. You work hard in order to create a product or a service and the moment it starts getting profitable, you suddenly become an expense. It's like working so that you can become unemployed.

Also the quality of the product has an impact. I have seen many times project managers running mad demanding "this little hack" that provides some functionality that their big cash-fat clients say they need. Soon architectures end up becoming a Frankenstein monster made of hacks. After some point the effort of maintaining those hacks acts as weight making changes progressively more difficult and expensive. Then the cost-savvy people suggest outsourcing, which gets us back to last argument.

Contradict the above with companies like say Microsoft or Paypal or GoCardless where each additional client's additional importance is small or can even be neglected. Would those companies envision things differently? How would they allocate resources or investments. Would they prefer to improve only existing client relationships or improve their offerings as much as possible creating a big barrier of entry for competitors?

## Elephants, Deer and Rabbits analogy

![Five ways diagram](/images/five_ways-animals.png "Five ways diagram")

I wasn't aware that the above points had been discussed in a slightly different context. While the cute image is from "[Five ways to build a $100 million business](http://christophjanz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html)", it seems that the original post is the "[Elephants, Deer and Rabbits - Some thoughts on start-up segmentation](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters/ 'Mark Suster Part of "Startup Lessons" series')" from Mark Suster. From that one I'm grabbing a strong but honest quote:

*"We started out with such big dreams about changing the world. On some level we felt we did because being a SaaS company in 1999 was trailblazing. But in the end we ended up building esoteric features that we knew our clients would never use because they paid us lots of money. See definition of a whore."*

Because there is some resemblance on the posts topic, I'd say that using the same analogy, companies are positioning themselves to the "elephants only please" category. If I was allowed I'd say "mammoth" oriented (one level above the elephant).

## An (originally) outsider's take

This is my root cause analysis of the situation: Coming originally from a classless society, I was surprised to find out a different structuring of society and affairs. Now having this experience, I believe that one reason for chasing the highest margins is the mentality of taking care of the needs of "the richest person in the room", while in other places it's better to serve the bottom of the income pyramid first and then move upwards. The logical steps would be
High Margin --> Needs of the few --> consultancy
while on the other hand
Volume --> Needs of the many --> Products or services

Paradoxically this kind of works: Because of the size of the country the critical mass of people plus funds which would support this approach exists. So a company can start and do well, at least for some time. Then it will almost deterministic reach a plateau, where it will be ripe for disruption from a Silicon Valley style startup. That's what happens on the macroscopic level.

Inside the company's microcosm, in the micro level, we have the "demoralization of the troops", the people that actually create wealth are not as much important as the customer facing yes-men (consultants), moreover they are treated as necessary evil / expense and that makes them sad, unproductive and disloyal, rightfully so it seems.
