title: Cultural slaps

On the third part decided to write about some cultural differences and their manifestations.

## Creatures of the hierarchy

Let's start with something from Quora http://www.quora.com/What-things-can-you-do-in-Israel-that-you-cannot-do-in-the-USA:

"What things can you do in Israel that you cannot do in the USA?

Tell your boss that he's an idiot and he's running the company into the ground, and still have a job the next day."

I'll contemplate on the whys, because it's here the same for Greeks (that's me) and maybe others. Let's start with stealing a line about company organization from this book (DOKSIADIS BOOK):
"Traditionally the cell of the Greek business unit is the boat. ... When crisis comes by usually in a form of a storm, they all need to break the hierarchy and save themselves cause else they're going to sink and die. It's easy to listen to people swearing at their superiors, doing each other's jobs if there is a gap and generally do whatever possible in order to get out of the situation. ..."

I can only assume that in Israel the same must hold truth but in the context of an army unit, or the traditional family living among foreigners. So in many cultures, when in doubt / crisis, break the hierarchy.

I painfully observed a completely different pattern while working in the UK:

People above me in organizational charts used to engage into general conversations in relaxed everyday situations. I've seen that in case of crisis a different pattern was the usual case: Everybody would blindly listen and  obey the leader, who would lead to salvation or move the company out of the crisis. Then we could all be friends again and chit chat it over a pint of beer.

I can only imagine how the other person might have felt in the following situation:
Richter (head of a client face department looking stressed): I want you to do XYZ for ABC (Actually it was "We need to do XYZ for ABC").
Me: Why?
Richter: One sentence explanation.
Me: Based on what you just said DEF is a better option than ABC, should we implement DEF instead?
Richter: I'll get back to you. Bye.

Only he didn't get back, he got to my manager. Next day my manager
Hanes: Hi, Richter came to me yesterday...
Me: I don't understand why. He must have given you his arguments, which you will repeat here filtered with what you understood. Yes?
Hanes: More or less.
Me: So based on the same input, I'll give the same response, I am frustrated that he bypassed me and got to you.
Hanes: You didn't understand, what he really wanted was you to say "Yes", not argue.
Me: But we are in crisis mode, if I don't know how he makes decisions, I will have to ask him for input every five minutes, if he provides an insight, then I'll be able to guess what he needs more or less.
Hanes: I see... for the moment next time say "Yes".

I will not tell you the ending of this story (it doesn't have a happy ending for me). But you got the point: Being behind schedule and in a bad place, my inertia was to break barriers, engage in direct communication... etc. Our Richter here wanted to basically issue an order and establish a hierarchy (I need this from you). When I communicated an unexpected message the gut reaction was again to follow the hierarchical approach, by talking to my manager. In my world, he'd probably talk to me straight instead of spending 10 minutes to find my manager and discuss over ("Hello? Aren't we behind schedule?").

OK that was the first slap, let's go to the second.

## It's a one way street

The second thing that stroke me was the unidirectional flow of information from the top to the bottom, but not the other way around.

I'll start with an anecdote again:

My then manager was preparing for the first appraisal. He had booked a meeting room. Once we sat, he said something like "Oops, I forgot the forms that we need to fill". Five minutes later he came in with some print outs, which he started reading and filling them with me. I was listening patiently and waiting to provide my input. At the end of the last paper, I replied with: "It seems that you forgot the remaining papers, do you want me to wait here". "What remaining papers?" was his response with the feeling of surprise painted over his face. "Up to now we have discussed about how I perform and what the company wants me to do. There is nothing about how good you are as my manager nor about how happy I am working here".

After that I started asking around. It seemed that in most places that was the case. Exception was (surprise!) foreign based companies operating in Britain. An example would be my experience in Accenture, there was grading of managers in both a semi-anonymous as well as formal fashion.

My opinion, without lots of thorough research, has to do with the concept of employment and how it is understood in different cultures. I tend to believe that in the US/Canada it's basically a contract, in capitalist terms: more or less two parts discuss on what can be offered to each other. Employee provides skill, labor, loyalty, some restrictions on their lives etc. The employer provides of course the salary and stability but we see more and more things like career path/trajectory, education and training as well as all those magic perks glorified by Google. It seems that there is a "deal" or a "package" that each one brings to the table.

In Britain and probably mostly in Europe it seems that employment stems from medieval serfdom with a twist. The twist is that you have the right to change employees without prosecution. Employer and employee agree to a salary and more or less that's it. I haven't witnessed in my employment in British companies things like: training programs, investment in expanding employees skill-set, even in buying books, or any worthwhile perks. Also I had witnessed recently a change in my job function without even announcing it. One day I got to the office and I was told that I should be doing "different things". When complaining that this was not aligned with the job description in the interview, the response was that I was right, but that the company was "evolving". For me this was breach of contract, for my manager it was business as usual. I should also feel happy.
