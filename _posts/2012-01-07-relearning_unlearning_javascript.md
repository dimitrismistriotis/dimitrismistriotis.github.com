Although I do not like "what I read on the web" posts, I really had to do this one for purposes of personal reference. As I dwell into the subject more, I aim update it. Aim of this post was to guide someone who already has an understanding of Javascript (me), to get deeper into the subject and understand the underlying mechanics.

## Before getting to the keyboard

Firstly started with some videos:

### "The good parts", which is a classic

### 10 Things I Learned from the jQuery Source

<a href="http://vimeo.com/12529436">Paul Irish : 10 Things I Learned from the jQuery Source</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/yayquery">yayQuery</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

<em>hint: a good thing with blogging: I just found out that there is a follow-up: <a title="11 More Things I Learned from the jQuery Source" href="http://vimeo.com/18901514" target="_blank">11 More Things I Learned from the jQuery Source</a>.</em>

## With the keyboard

Knowing that there are some Koans available, went straight to download from github: <a title="Javascript Koans" href="https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans" target="_blank">JavaScript Koans</a>. After working with them I learned/discovered/remembered the following:

* <a title="Mozilla Developer Network" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a> is a great resource
* About equality and numbers, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN" target="_blank">NaN not equal to NaN</a> and <a href="http://www.mapbender.org/JavaScript_pitfalls:_null,_false,_undefined,_NaN#NaN" target="_blank">mapbender.org</a>,
* Array method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice" target="_blank">Splice</a>,
* Was windblown by the workings of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval" target="_blank">eval</a>.

At the end of the journey the familiar "victory" message:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Javascript Koans end hrml" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1995706/cdn/blog/jskoans_end.gif" alt="" width="261" height="49" /></p>

## CoffeeScript

For many people a language that compiles to javascript is they way to go. Decided to try out <a href="http://coffeescript.org" target="_blank">coffescript</a> to see by myself. Got converted. Result of this was the publication of <a title="CoffeeScript cheat sheet" href="http://www.cheatography.com/dimitrios/cheat-sheets/coffeescript-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">CoffeScript cheat sheet</a> at <a title="Cheatography.com" href="http://www.cheatography.com/" target="_blank">cheatography</a>, which I maintain as I learn more.

## ToDos

This is the work done up to this update, this post at some poing will be enriched with investigation into unit testing frameworks, experiments and more exercises if good ones will be found. Also from top of my head interested to investigate: minification utilities, packaging.
