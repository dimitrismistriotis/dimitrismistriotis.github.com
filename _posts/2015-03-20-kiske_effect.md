# The Kiske field

This is the preface/teaser of a larger post about British IT, decided to split it in order to give out smaller chunks. A very important **disclaimer**: I have not been able to talk with the people involved in the story below nor check it out extensively, so please treat the story in the next section as fiction.

## Definition - first story.

More than 10 years before, [Iron Maiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden 'Iron Maiden - Wikipedia') was the biggest heavy metal band on the planet. At some point their singer, [Bruce Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson 'Bruce Dickinson - Wikipedia') decided to leave the band and pursue a solo career. The remaining members wanted to continue, but they needed first to find someone to replace the empty seat.  At that point the band decided to do an international competition in order to choose their next singer. Being in an era before MP3, people where sending recordings of themselves singing or other material mostly in cassettes and send that over. Leader of the band at that time was the legendary [Steve Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harris_%28musician%29 'Steve Harris - Wikipedia').

At about that time a hot discussion topic among fans of the genre was who would be the next "Dickinson". Among the hundreds of tapes that the band received, one was [Blaze Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley 'Blaze Bailey - Wikipedia'), who was at then singing in an English niche band that almost no-one had ever heard of. Another candidate of the many, was the well known heavy metal singer and front-man [Michael Kiske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kiske 'Michael Kiske - Wikipedia'), which brings us to the next part.

Many years later, I was operating a fanzine and was working part time as a metal journalist, so I had the chance to meet Blaze Bailey for an interview after he had left the band. The funny thing with Blaze when asked, was how lucky he fell even if it didn't last long and how surprised he was. Another friend of mine had interviewed Michael Kiske.  Kiske was always doing other things, but when asked off the record (this is what I cannot prove or confirm) he said that the rumor "in the business" was that *"Steve Harris would never accept a non-Englishman to lead England's best heavy metal band, so he did an international competition in order to choose the best English-man"*.

Based on the (unconfirmed) story above, definition of the "Kiske law":

**Choosing the best English person from a list of international candidates**

And for ease of use the lemma-definition of a "Kiske field":

**A company on which hiring and promotions are influenced by the Kiske law (see above)**

## A story

This is a real story, with the industry and the names of the people involved changed. It's about a friend of mine named Daniella. Daniella is one of the best account managers on her field at least in Europe. Because of her very busy schedule I lately meet her at about once per year. Two years before, she was talking to me about why she would look for changing companies "*soon*":

*"When I joined the company almost everybody on our team was from Europe's south (say [PIGS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_%28economics%29 'PIGS')), we were handling a range of client accounts and were usually working long hours. After the first two years with the company established, the decided was made to stabilize the number of clients and acquisition rate.

I found out that as old employees started leaving, in expected turnover rates, the new hires were being paid more for less amount of work. Also all the new hires are locals. This was one of the signals that I had to move on"*

Following Daniella's posts on Facebook (:-[), I saw that some months later she is head of European operations for her sector in a large multinational. The multinational though is a company based in Scandinavia. When I read her celebratory post and the subsequent ones, I couldn't help myself but wonder if the same story would possible on a UK multinational.

I have heard many stories, I also have mine. This though describes best the "Kiske effect".

## Analysis

Decided not to write about personal experiences mainly because of emotional involvement, which makes me prone to expressing myself inappropriately and open for a he-said-she-said type of argument. Generally I've observed the following pattern at least on the IT positions that I had:

1. First generation foreigners are usually treated as glorified temp employees. At any given time they might get back to their country of origin.
2. As a result promoting them into mid-level management is at least a risky proposal since their departure will create a difficult to replace gap (or think of a potentially cascading/domino effect).
3. This in turn has an effect on their (our) mentality and psychology: being marginalized or exploited does not contribute to corporate loyalty; hence
4. They (we) in effect are prone to switch jobs, since there is no emotional or career related attachment with the current employer.

Some additional thoughts on the points above:

In my opinion (1) is still the case for many people, but it's what I'd call if allowed a "leaky assumption" moreover now compared with the recent past. Allow me to elaborate:

As the story goes the "deal" about a foreigner in the UK, more specially in London was that the short career course would be in those lines: Study (BSc), maybe more studies (MSc), maybe internship, permanent work for a couple of years, bang! or one promotion some more years and bang!

Where "bang!" equals return to the country of origin, with UK or moreover London credibility, which for some reason is a good salary multiplier. Something similar was happening with children of rural Britain. That's why people were OK living in stacked up flat-shares with broken bathrooms, ultra-long commutes from the Crystal Palaces of this world, etc. It was supposed to be a temporary thing. Well until it's not. Having recession all over the globe, people say from the PIGS countries cannot go back, even if they want to. So point (1) above holds still but not as much. It is possible that the business world has not yet adjusted... Maybe.

Second point enhances the side-effects of point 1 - again in the past. Getting promoted
increased the perceived value on the country of origin. Being a manager "here" translates to Sr Manager "there" so promotion can lead to a "bang!"

Last points (3 and 4) are about what's happening on the other side: Imagine that you start working in a company, you do your best for a couple of years. You don't see promotion or a change in your salary or even a discussion about it. For some reason this happens with other people, you are not even updated. What would you think? More important what would you do?

All of the above create a vicious circle, so let's ask: **Is your company in a Kiske field?**
