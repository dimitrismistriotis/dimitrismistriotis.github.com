# The Kiske effect

This is the preface/teaser of a larger post about British IT, decided to split it in order to give out smaller chunks. A very important **disclaimer**: I have not been able to talk with the people involved in the story below nor check it out from the press of that time, so please treat the story as fiction.

## Observation and definition

More than 10 years before, [Iron Maiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden 'Iron Maiden - wikipedia') was the biggest heavy metal band on the planet. At some point their singer, [Bruce Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson 'Bruce Dickinson - Wikipedia') decided to leave the band and pursue a solo career. At that point, because the rest of their members wanted to continue. Leader of the band at this time was the legendary [Steve Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harris_%28musician%29 'Steve Harris - wikipedia'). At that point the band decided to do an international competition in order to choose their next singer. At that point in antiquity people had to record themselves singing mostly in cassettes and send that over.

I come in story because at that point I used to a metal-head and I remember it being  hot topic of discussion among fans on who would be next. Among the hundreds of tapes that the band received, one was from the mostly unknown [Blaze Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley 'Blaze Bailey - wikipedia'), who was at then singing in an English niche band that no-one had ever heard of. Another one among very well known metal singers was [Michael Kiske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kiske 'Michael Kiske - wikipedia'), which brings us to the next part.

Many years later, I was operating a fanzine and was working part time as a metal journalist, so I had the chance to meet and interview Blaze Bailey after he'd left the band. Another friend of mine had done the same with Michael Kiske. The funny thing with Blaze when asked, was how lucky he fell even if it didn't last long and how surprised he was. Kiske was always doing other things, but when asked after an interview and off the record (this is what I cannot prove or confirm so from now on it's VERY risky to accept it) he said that the rumor was that *"Steve Harris would never accept a non-Englishman to lead England's best heavy metal act, so he did an international competition in order to choose the best English person for the job"*.

Based on the unconfirmed story above, this is the "Kiske law":

**The process of choosing the best English person from a list of international candidates**

And for ease of use the definition of a "Kiske field":

**A company on which human resources makes decisions following the Kiske law (see above)**

After enraging some million fans of the band and tens of millions of British people (if this post gets that much attention), let's move on...

## Another story

This is a real story, I just changed the industry and the names of the people involved. It's about a friend of mine named Daniella. Daniella is not just an account manager, she is actually one of the best on her field planet-wise. Because of her very busy schedule I talk to her almost once per year lately. Two years before, she was talking to me about why she would look for a job "soon":

*"When I joined the company almost everybody on our team was from Europe's south (note: lets say PIGS with "i" for Italy), we had a range of client accounts and we were working usually long hours. After the company got established, it decided to stabilize the number of clients and it's expansion rate.

I found out that as employees were switching companies, the new hires were being paid more for less amount of work, while all of them are locals. This signals that I need to move on"*

Following Daniella from Facebook (:-[), I saw that some months later she is head of European operations on her sector for a large multinational. The multinational company though is based in a Scandinavian country. When I read her "who-hoo" post and subsequent ones, I couldn't help but wander if that would be a possibility on a UK multinational or not.

## Personal experience - analysis

Decided not to write about personal experiences mainly because of emotional involvement, which makes me prone to inappropriately express myself; also it might lead into a he-said-she-said argument. Generally I've observed the following pattern at least on the IT positions that I had:

1. First generation foreigners are usually treated as glorified temp employees. At any given time they might get back to their country of origin.
2. As a result promoting them into mid-level management is at least a risky proposal since their departure will create a difficult to replace gap (or think of a potentially cascading/domino effect).
3. This in turn has an effect on their (our) mentality and psychology: being marginalized or exploited does not contribute to corporate loyalty; hence
4. They (we) in effect are prone to switch jobs, since there is no attachment with the company either emotional or related with career prospects.

Some additional thoughts on the points above:

In my opinion (1) is still the case for many people, but it's what I'd call if allowed a "leaky assumption" moreover now compared with the recent past. Allow me to elaborate:

As the story goes the "deal" about a foreigner in the UK, more specially in London was that the short career course would be in those lines: Study (BSc), maybe more studies (MSc), maybe internship, permanent work for a couple of years, bang! or one promotion some more years and bang!

Where "bang!" is return to the country of origin, with UK or moreover London credibility, which for some reason is a good salary multiplier. Something similar was happening with children of rural Britain. That's why people were OK living in stacked up flat-shares with broken bathrooms, ultra-long commutes from the Crystal Palaces of this world, etc. It was supposed to be a temporary thing. Well until it's not. Having recession all over the globe, people say from the PIGS countries cannot go back, even if they want to. So point (1) above holds still but not as much. Probably the business world has not yet adjusted... Probably.
