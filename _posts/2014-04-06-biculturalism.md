title: Biculturalism
---

Title's idea came from Joel Spolsky's article on Unix vs Windows. This article is about traders vs developers on managing an organization.

Intro:

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, so my story kind of matters.

Pattern: Interview or get to know. Great guy (me), great guys them. Initial contract to see if we mix. Failout ended up hiring someone else.

Second time was mind blowing did same things I had in mind. Decided to stay a bit longer and observe him - What I've learned.

Cultrural differences:

Work more vs work better.

Also work all day.

Where debugging, new approaches and strategies happen for me: on my way to the office and in my sleep!

Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Money and hiring people.

Tooling lots of PHP :-(

More is more vs Less is more.

Don't pay lots.

Build always something that is very good in generating revenue from the start.
