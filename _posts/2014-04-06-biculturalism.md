title: Biculturalism: Developers and traders as startup founders.
---

Title's idea originates from a Joel Spolsky's article about something else. It is about the approaches on managing a startup by people from a trading or financial background against those of ones from an IT background. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my career, a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

## Intro

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, which later on discussed with peers.

First time, I met two ex-trader(s) for an interview, followed up  with a short-term contract role to see if we mix. Ended in a bad fallout. Second time was more exciting. Founders ended up hiring someone else, but I had the chance to stay a bit longer and observe how company was progressing.

## Differences

In a nutshell, running a **sprint** versus a **marathon**: (financial) City mentality is extremely reactive and is based on working exhaustive and long hours. This brings an unavoidable conflict with fundamental functioning of the IT industry such as problem engagement, domain understanding and others. Usually the money wielders are incapable or unwilling to understand the differences of the two different fields, so they constantly project their approach to their IT teams.

### Work more vs work better

Most important observation and the heart of my argument, is the instilled mentality on the finance industry that better result is always achieved my working **more**. More hours trading generally equals more profit, as well as observing patterns, experiences and generally capability expansion on the field.

Unfortunately this does not directly apply to the IT industry, specially in development, which is dominating on the first steps of a startup. From it's own nature need is to work **better**: being a developer in a startup means that you will have to do things that have probably never been done before. Things unachievable after being drained by long 14-hour workdays.

IMHO there needs to be a balance between producing what a company needs "right here right now" and being able to theoritise and reason for the next steps, something that involves studying, experimenting, talking to peers or taking time for things to crystallize in a person's brain.

It is important to state that the post is about employees not founders. Founder has to wear many hats during the day (marketing, accounting, HR, business development) and of course has the effect that while say the accountant role takes over, the "strictly" developer one is resting.

### Be always 'on' vs being able to switch 'off'

The financial employee is expected to be available even when not in the office. This combined with the reactive mentality constantly generates real and fake emergencies that somehow need to be handled. Sooner or later we have an always-available approach. The immediate effect is the disruption of the  capability to learn anything new.

The accumulative effect this creates a vicious circle for development: the quality of the work suffers. Consequently applications usually end up with a hack-y architecture, developed in a patchy way, poorly tested and documented. Because of these factors they need lots of effort in maintenance. Necessary changes will almost definitely break other things. As a result more emergencies that need human supervision will be created. This will increase the need to be always available.

### Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Another aspect from the trading industry is about handling disruptions, urgencies, immediate opportunities and other external factors. On the other had on the IT world there is the need for extended time focusing on specific issues.

From my experience, I have more than once been a situation where I have to stop working on something to fix a "bug", again while doing this stopped to handle something else, ending up juggling through tasks. It is very common to receive emails requiring updates, as if somehow responding or seeing them blip in my email client will make me more productive. At the end of the day a large amount of time and effort has been consumed in context switching, with a very low output. At least a demotivating experience for IT teams.

### Market awareness

It might seems that I am against working for startups founded by traders, I am not. There is one point that changes everything: Trading founders are more capable than anyone else to understand markets dynamics, create a compelling business proposition, execute and promote their idea.

This contrasts with many founders from design or software fields that subconsciously want to excel or be recognized for their merit on their field such as craftsmanship, a clever marketing campaign or design awards. Trading founders treat their businesses as an institution that needs to generate revenue and that gives them the necessary focus to act properly in order achieve it.

### Over-engineering

Following up from the previous point, founders from an engineering background have a tendency to over engineer. This has to do either because of some introversion or being  embarrassed to get out and talk to people. Somehow having at the back of their heads that a compelling value proposition will make these discussions easier, postpones the necessary get-out-of-the-building phase that is necessary to start the discussion with their target market.
This usually doesn't happen to people that are more or less trained to sell, knowing that most discussions don't end up in a sale anyway.

## Wrap up

So it's sprint vs marathon. If you end up in a startup founded by people from a training background you will have to live sprinting along with long days spent mostly on fire-fighting and reacting to crises. You will be running towards the right direction in an ever-slowing pace.

On the other hand if you end up with people from an engineering background, it will be more like a marathon. You will be running in a steady pace, improving things day by day. You might though find that the company is moving to the wrong direction when it's too late.
