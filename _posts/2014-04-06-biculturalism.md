title: Biculturalism: Developers VS traders in startups.
---

Title's idea came from Joel Spolsky's article on Unix vs Windows. This article is about traders vs developers on managing an organization. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my career, you can treat it as a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

## Intro

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, so my story kind of matters.

Pattern: Interview or get to know. Great guy (me), great guys them. Initial contract to see if we mix. After a fallout they ended up hiring someone else. Second time was more exciting. There I decided to stay a bit longer and observe how things were going.

## Differences

In a nutshell: City mentality is extremely reactive and is based on working exhaustive and long hours heads down. This brings an unavoidable conflict with concepts of the IT industry such as engagement, understanding the domain, progressive refactoring, architecture and others. Usually the money wielders are not capable to understand, or just do not want to, the differences of the two different fields, so they project their approach to their IT teams.

### Work more vs work better

Most important observation and the heart of my argument, is the instilled mentality on the finance industry that result is always achieved my working **more**. This happens because the more you trade, the more money you make, but also start observing patterns, gain experience while generally expanding your capabilities.

Unfortunately this cannot always be projected to the IT industry, specially to development, which from it's nature demands to always work **better** as well as be creative: being a developer in a startup means that you will have to do things that at some point have never been done before. Things unachievable after being drained by long 14-hour workdays.

IMHO there needs to be a balance between producing what a company needs and being able to theoritise and reason for the next steps, something that might need studying, talking to peers or taking time for things to crystallize in developer's brain.

It is important to state that the discussion is not about the status of the founder, but that of the employee. The founder wears many hats during the day (marketing, accounting, HR, business development) and of course has the effect that while say the accountant role takes over, the employee one is resting.

An example: At the time of writing, I walk to work every day for about 35 minutes. Most of this time I think on what and how I should work for the day, on my way back I reflect and draw draw conclusions for the next days. Less than six months before, while I was freelancing for a startup founded by traders, roughly in the same commute, I was trying to zone out as much as possible. I was leaving work exhausted and just did not want to be there any longer.

### Be always 'on' vs being able to switch 'off'

The employee is expected to be available also when not in the office. The reactive approach generates either real or fake emergencies that somehow need to be handled. This apart from having possible effects to someone's life, destroys the capability to learn, take an on-line course, read or even write a blog post or a paper.

The accumulative effect this creates a vicious circle: because of it, the quality of the work suffers. As a consequence applications many times end up with an improper hacked architecture, developed in an unstructured way, poorly tested and documented. Because of these factors they need lots of effort in maintenance, changes will almost definitely break other things down the line, which as a result will create more emergencies that need human supervision to handle.

Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Money and hiring people.

Tooling lots of PHP :-(

More is more vs Less is more.

Don't pay lots.

Build always something that is very good in generating revenue from the start.
