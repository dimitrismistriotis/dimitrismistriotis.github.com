title: Biculturalism - Developers and traders as startup founders.
---

Title's idea originates from a Joel Spolsky's article about something else. It is about the approaches on managing a startup by people from a trading or financial background against those of ones from an IT background. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my career, a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

## Intro

First time, I met two ex-trader(s) for an interview, followed up  with a short-term contract role to see if we mix. Ended in a bad fallout. Second time was more exciting. Founders ended up hiring someone else, but I had the chance to stay a bit longer and observe how company was progressing. Afterwards I started asking around and gathered anecdotal material from other peers.

## Differences

In a nutshell, running a **sprint** versus a **marathon**: (financial) City mentality is extremely reactive and based on working exhaustive, long hours. This brings an unavoidable conflict with fundamental functions of the IT industry such as problem engagement, domain understanding and others. Usually traders are incapable or unwilling to understand the differences of the two different fields, so they prefer to project their approach to other teams.

### Work more vs work better

Most important observation and heart of my argument, is the instilled mentality of the finance industry that better results are always achieved by working **more** following a linear correlation. More working hours generally translate to more profit, observing patterns, experience and generally capability expansion on the field.

Unfortunately this does not directly project to the IT industry. Specially for development which dominates the first steps of a startup. There is the need to work **better**: being a developer in a startup means that you will have to do things that have probably never been done before. Something unachievable if drained by long 14-hour workdays.

IMHO there needs to be a balance between producing what a company needs "right here right now" and being able reason about the next steps, which can involve studying, experimenting, talking to peers or taking time for things to crystallize in a person's brain.

It is important to state that the post is about employees not founders. Founder has to wear many hats during the day (marketing, accounting, HR, business development) and of course has the effect that while say the accountant role takes over, the "strictly" developer part is resting.

### Be always 'on' vs being able to switch 'off'

The financial employee is expected to be available even when not in the office. This combined with the reactive mentality constantly generates real and fake emergencies that somehow need to be handled. Sooner or later an always-available approach is established.

A vicious circle is created for development: The quality of the output suffers, consequently applications usually end up with a hack-y architecture, developed in a patchy way, poorly tested and documented. Because of these factors lots of effort in maintenance is required. Necessary changes will almost definitely break other things, resulting to more emergencies that need human supervision. This will increase the need to be always available reinforcing the circle.

### Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Trading industry involves handling disruptions, urgencies, immediate opportunities and other external events. On the other had on the IT world there is the need for extended time blocks focusing on one issue at a time.

Not only from my own experience, it is common to be in a situation where work on something stops working in order to fix a "bug". Then being interrupted again while doing this to handle something else, ending up juggling through tasks. People have been receiving hourly emails requiring updates, as if somehow writing 10 minutes responses will fix issues faster. At the end of the day a large amount of time and effort has been consumed on context switching, with a very low output, something at demotivating.

### Market awareness

It might seems that I advice against working for startups founded by traders, I am not. There is one point that alone can change everything: Trading founders are more capable than anyone else to **understand** markets dynamics, create a compelling business proposition, execute and promote their idea.

This contrasts with many founders from design or software fields that suffer from a subconscious need to excel on their respective fields. Interested in things like craftsmanship, a clever but not necessarily effective marketing campaign or chasing design awards, they are more prone to get distracted in these activities neglecting the needs of their company. Trading founders treat their businesses as an institution that needs to generate sustainable revenue as soon as possible and that gives them the necessary focus to act properly in order achieve it.

### Over-engineering

Continuing from the previous point, founders from an engineering background have a tendency to over engineer and over polish their products, which might have to do has to do either with introversion.

There is the hope that the the get-out-of-the-building phase and the dialog with the market will be easier or smoother if backed up by a compelling product or service, so it makes sense to postpone it for a while. This usually doesn't happen to people that are more or less trained to sell, knowing that most discussions don't end up in a sale anyway.

## Wrap up

It is a sprint-marathon choice. If you get in a startup founded by people from a training background you will have to sprint in long working days spent mostly on reactive fire-fighting. You will be running towards the right direction with an increasing weight slowing down.

On the other hand if you get with people from an engineering background, it will be more like a marathon, running with a steady pace, improving things day by day. You might though be moving towards the wrong direction having everybody realize it when it's too late.
