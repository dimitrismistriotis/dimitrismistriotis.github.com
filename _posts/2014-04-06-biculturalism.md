title: Biculturalism: Developers and traders as startup founders.
---

Title's idea came from Joel Spolsky's article on something completely different, Unix vs Windows. This article is about the approach that people from a trading/financial background have on managing a startup versus people from a development/IT background. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my career, which can be treated as a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

## Intro

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, so my story kind of matters.

First time: Meet ex-trader(s) for an interview or a soft-interview (coffee). Follow up with a short-term contract role to see if we mix. Ends in a fallout or disaster. Afterwards they end up hiring someone else.

Second time was more exciting. I had the chance to stay a bit longer and observe how things were progressing.

## Differences

In a nutshell, running a **sprint** against running a **marathon**: City mentality is extremely reactive and is based on working exhaustive and long heads down hours. This brings an unavoidable conflict with fundamental functions of the IT industry such as engagement, understanding the domain, progressive refactoring, architecture and others. Usually the money wielders are not capable or willing to understand the differences of the two different fields, so they project their approach to their IT teams.

### Work more vs work better

Most important observation and the heart of my argument, is the instilled mentality on the finance industry that result is always achieved my working **more**. Possibly because the more you trade, the more money you make, as well as start observing patterns, gain experience and generally expand your capabilities.

Unfortunately this does not apply to the IT industry all the time and everywhere, specially in development. From it's own nature it usually demands to work **better**, sometimes with a creative element: being a developer in a startup means that you will have to do things that have never been done before. Things unachievable after being drained by long 14-hour workdays.

IMHO there needs to be a balance between producing what a company needs and being able to theoritise and reason for the next steps, something that involves studying, experimenting, talking to peers or taking time for things to crystallize in developer's brain.

It is important to state that the discussion is not founders, but employees. Founder has to wear many hats during the day (marketing, accounting, HR, business development) and of course has the effect that while say the accountant role takes over, the "strictly" developer one is resting.

### Be always 'on' vs being able to switch 'off'

The financial employee is expected to be available also when not in the office. The reactive mentality of his/her managers constantly generates real or fake emergencies that somehow need to be handled. Sooner or later this leads to a always-available mentality. This apart from affecting someone's life, disrupts capability to learn by taking an on-line course, reading related literature moreover write a blog post or a paper.

The accumulative effect this creates a vicious circle: because of it, the quality of the work suffers. As a consequence applications many times end up with a hack-y architecture, developed in a patchy way, poorly tested and documented. Because of these factors they need lots of effort in maintenance, changes will almost definitely break other things down the line, which as a result will create more emergencies that need human supervision to handle. This will reinforce the need to be always available.

#### But I can do it!

Having discussed the above with people from the financial sector in off-the-record environments, I was exposed to the following arguments. Comments are mine:

"You do this for five to ten years and then do something else/retire": Yes! In the financial sector many people sacrifice some years of their life without free time, hobbies, holidays or family. Then they get out with a load of money and/or stock and do whatever they want. They can even retire if they want to another country. This will never happen to IT or developers only because their salaries are never even in the same order of magnitude (maybe with some exceptions). With most of the CTO salaries I have seen around, you will definitely not be able to retire after 10 years of working. And if you mess up and have to retire, nobody will give you a Â£2.5M bonus as in the head of RBS...

"But we pay everybody above the marker rate": This is sometimes true, some finance people pay above the market rate, but again this is not an excuse for weird expectations. Market also defines working conditions for each profession, which is also defined by it's specific circumstances paying extra does not directly mean that employees can become auto-magically more productive as described above.

"This is the only way you can do something in business/life": Of course if we post-fix this sentence with "in the finance industry". As explained there are many ways to reach your business goals, one is being more smart every day.

### Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Another aspect from the trading industry is the reaction to disruption, external factors and urgency. In the trading world interruption usually translates to risk mitigation or opportunity. On the other had on the IT world there is the need for extended time of focus on a specific problem.

From my experience, I have more than once experienced a situation where I have to stop while I am working on something in order to fix a "bug", while having to handle something else, ending with spending the time just juggling through tasks. It is very common to receive emails for "updates" as if somehow responding to emails or seeing them blipping in my email client will somehow make me more productive. At the end of the day a large amount of time and effort has been consumed in context switching, with a very low output. At least a demotivating experience for IT teams.

### Market awareness

It seems that I am against working for startups founded by traders, but there is one point that completely turns the tables: Trading founders are equipped more than anyone else to understand how markets work, create a compelling business proposition, execute and promote their idea.

This contrasts with many founders from other fields that might want to excel or be recognized for their design or software craftsmanship or clever marketing campaign or even win awards. Trading founders treat their businesses as an institution that at the end of the day needs to generate revenue and that makes them almost unbeatable on their capability to acquire all the necessary resources to achieve it.

### Over-engineering

Again following up from the previous point, founders from an engineering background have a tendency to over engineer. This has to do either because of some introversion and being too embarrassed to get out and talk to people without a "great" suggestion or by judging their output based on technical merit and not on market value. Whichever the case, this usually doesn't happen to people that are more or less more eager to sell, knowing that most discussions don't end up in a sale anyway.

## Wrap up

So it's sprint vs marathon. If you end up in a startup founded by people from a training background you will have to live sprinting along with long days spent mostly on fire-fighting and reacting to crises. You will be running towards the right direction in an ever-slowing pace.

On the other hand if you end up with people from an engineering background, it will be more like a marathon. You will be running in a steady pace, improving things day by day. You might though find that the company is moving to the wrong direction when it's too late.
