title: Biculturalism: Developers and traders.
---

Title's idea came from Joel Spolsky's article on Unix vs Windows. This article is about traders vs developers on managing an organization. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my carreer, you can treat it as a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

Intro:

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, so my story kind of matters.

Pattern: Interview or get to know. Great guy (me), great guys them. Initial contract to see if we mix. Failout ended up hiring someone else.

Second time was mind blowing did same things I had in mind. Decided to stay a bit longer and observe him - What I've learned.
One thing observed: Darwinian fitness for the position was unquestionable.

Cultural differences:

Work more vs work better:

Also work all day: Always on approach from the City.

Time away from the office doesn't contribute. This is another area where the different approaches diverge a lot. My best ideas about changing architecture, solving a bug or doing something that would vastly improve the systems under my supervision have happened on Sundays, after I saw something that I could apply on a presentation, from a podcast on Vimeo or Youtube and more times that I'd like to admit on my sleep or just when I woke up.

Where debugging, new approaches and strategies happen for me: on my way to the office and in my sleep!

Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Money and hiring people.

Tooling lots of PHP :-(

More is more vs Less is more.

Don't pay lots.

Build always something that is very good in generating revenue from the start.
