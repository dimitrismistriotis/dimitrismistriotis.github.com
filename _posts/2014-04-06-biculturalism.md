title: Biculturalism: Developers VS traders in startups.
---

Title's idea came from Joel Spolsky's article on Unix vs Windows. This article is about traders vs developers on managing an organization. It is a part of a series of posts on how I mismanaged my carreer, you can treat it as a *"how I failed so that you don't have to"* post.

## Intro

Has happened to me twice, but I have observed a general pattern, so my story kind of matters.

Pattern: Interview or get to know. Great guy (me), great guys them. Initial contract to see if we mix. Failout ended up hiring someone else. Second time was more exchiting. There I decided to stay a bit longer and observe how things were going.

## Differences

In a nutshell: City mentality is extremely reactive and is based on working exhustive and long hours heads down. This brings an unavoidable conflict with concepts of the IT industry such as engagement, understanding the domain, progressive refactoring, architecture and others. Usually the money wielders are not capable to understand, or just do not want to, the differences of the two different fields, so they project their approach to their IT teams.

### Work more vs work better

Most important observation and the heart of my argument, is the instilled mentality on the finance industry that result is always achieved my working **more**. This happens because the more you trade, the more money you make, but also start observing patterns, gain experience adn generally increase your capabilities - as an employee (please bear with me until I explain why this is important).

Unfortunately this cannot always be projected to the IT industry, specially to development, which from it's nature demands to always work **better** as well as be creative: being a developer in a startup means that you will have to do things that at some point have never been done before. Things unachievable after being drained by long 14-hour workdays.

IMHO there needs to be a balance between producing what a company needs and being able to theoritise and reason for the next steps, something that might need studying, talking to peers or taking time for things to crystalise in developer's brain.

An example: At the time of writing, I walk to work every day for about 35 minutes. Most of this time I think on what and how I should work for the day, on my way back I reflect and draw draw conclusions for the next days. Less than six months before, while I was freelancing for a startup founded by traders, roughly in the same commute, I was trying to zone out as much as possible. I was leaving work exhausted and just did not want to be there any longer.

### Be always on vs being able to switch off

Also work all day: Always on approach from the City.

Time away from the office doesn't contribute. This is another area where the different approaches diverge a lot. My best ideas about changing architecture, solving a bug or doing something that would vastly improve the systems under my supervision have happened on Sundays, after I saw something that I could apply on a presentation, from a podcast on Vimeo or Youtube and more times that I'd like to admit on my sleep or just when I woke up.

Where debugging, new approaches and strategies happen for me: on my way to the office and in my sleep!

Interruptions - reactive approach to everything

Money and hiring people.

Tooling lots of PHP :-(

More is more vs Less is more.

Don't pay lots.

Build always something that is very good in generating revenue from the start.
