On the third part decided to write about some cultural differences in doing business and their manifestations.

## Creatures of the hierarchy

Starting with an entry in Quora http://www.quora.com/What-things-can-you-do-in-Israel-that-you-cannot-do-in-the-USA:

"*What things can you do in Israel that you cannot do in the USA?*

*Tell your boss that he's an idiot and he's running the company into the ground, and still have a job the next day.*"

Let's add another quote, this was from a person of western European origin that owned a small shop in the tourist industry in a Greek city:

"*Greeks are some of the best employees you could have, trustworthy, energetic, active. The problem with then is that at some point they will come and tell you how to run your business.*"

I'll contemplate on the whys, because it's here the same for Greeks (that's me) and maybe others. Let's start with a loose translation about internal company organization from a book about Greek economy, "(The invisible chasm)[http://www.public.gr/product/books/greek-books/economics/economics/to-aorato-rigma/prod5810148pp/]":

"Traditionally the cell of a Greek business unit is a boat. ... When a crisis comes, usually in a form of a storm, everybody needs act individually saving themselves and everybody else present otherwise they whole boat sinks and all aboard die. It is common to listen to people swearing at their superiors, huge overlapping of each other's functions if a vacuum occurs,  generally do whatever possible in order to get out of the situation. ..."

I can only assume that in Israel the same must be the case in the context of an army unit, or the traditional family living in distant countries among different nationals, the (goyim)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy]. For a number cultures, when in doubt break hierarchy.

I painfully observed a completely different approach while working in the UK:

People above me in organizational charts used to engage into general conversations while in relaxed everyday situations, the "how was your weekend" talks. In case of crisis or when things got serious a different pattern of behaviour was observed: Everybody would blindly listened and obeyed *the leader*, whose responsibility was to guide the company or their team out of the crisis. Then we would all be friends again and chit chat over a pint of beer.

I can only imagine how Rayn, head of a client face department, might have felt in the following situation, talking with me:
Ryan (looking stressed): "We *need* to do XYZ for ABC" (note: not "I want you to do *ABC* for XYZ").
Me: Why?
Ryan: blah blah (one sentence explanation)
Me: Based on what you just said *DEF* is a better option than *ABC*, should we try *DEF* instead?
Ryan: I'll get back to you. Bye.

Only that he never got back to me, but went instead to my then manager, Kevin. Next day Kevin came along:
Kevin: Hi, Ryan came to me yesterday...
Me: I do not understand why. He must have given you his arguments, which you will repeat to me along with your understanding of the situation. Yes?
Kevin: More or less.
Me: So based on the same inputs, I will provide the same response. Now I am additionally frustrated because he bypassed me and got to you.
Kevin: You didn't understand, what he really wanted was you to say "*Yes*", not argue about his points.
Me: But we are in crisis mode, if I don't know how he got to these points, I will have to ask for his input every five minutes. If on the other hand he provides his insight, then I will be able to guess his needs without disrupting him.
Kevin: I see... for the moment next time limit yourself to a "Yes" answer.

I will not tell you the not so happy for me conclusion of this story. But you got the point: Being behind schedule and in a bad place, my inertia was to break barriers, engage in direct communication... etc. Ryan for the same reasons in the example above issued an order. Inspired by a hierarchical understanding of the situation someone should lead (himself of course), so an approach in the lines of "*I need you to do this*" was more appropriate. When my response was not the expected one, his gut reaction was - again - to follow the hierarchical approach, by approaching to my manager. If I could guess what his reaction would have been, it would be probably talking to me on the spot in the first place. Finding my manager,then explaining his point of view even more when in behind-schedule-stress mode was a glorified waste of his time, to say the least. Of course you should not bet on my guess.

What also should also be considered is the potential shock-wave delivered to our story's Ryan: We were in crisis-mode, so in his mindset everyone should be in the realm of "yes". Instead of that, he got a full spectrum challenging of his assumptions. In hindsight that should have been an "ouch" moment, a very negative surprise indeed ...

This gets us to the second slap.

## It's a one way street

The second thing that stroke me was the unidirectional flow of information from the top to the bottom, without the existence of bottom-up information channels.

Starting again with an anecdote:

My then manager was preparing for my first appraisal for which he had a meeting room booked. Once we sat, he said something like "Oops, I forgot the forms in the printer". Five minutes later he came back with some printouts, which we started reading and filling out. I was listening patiently waiting to provide my input and counter-argue some of his remarks after the process was over. After finishing the last paper, I replied with something like: "*It seems that you forgot the remaining forms, do you want me to wait here or should I go and fetch them?*". "*What remaining papers?*" was his response with an imaginary cartoon-style question mark dangling over his face. "*Up to now we have discussed about how I perform and what the company or you wants me to do or improve. There is nothing about how good you are as my manager nor about how happy I am working here or my career path. Isn't that covered in the forms you forgot?*".

After that I started asking around. It seemed that in most places that was the state of affairs. Exception was foreign based companies operating  British branch. An counter-example would be my experience in Accenture, there was grading of managers in both a semi-anonymous as well as in formal fashion.

My opinion, without thorough research though, has to do with the concept of employment and how it is understood in different cultures. I tend to believe that in the US/Canada it resembles conceptually a **contract**: more or less two parts discuss on what each one offers to the other. Employee provides her skill, labour, loyalty, some restrictions on their lives etc. The employer provides the salary,job stability but also career path/trajectory, education, training as well as all some so called perks. With the king of "perks" being Google (where is it based?). It seems that there is an agreed "deal". An employee breaking the “deal” find themselves fired. If the company does so, there has to be some justification, which was not the case in our last story.

In Britain and probably mostly in Europe it seems that employment stems from **medieval serfdom** with many improvements. One of them is that you have the right to change employees without prosecution. Employer and employee agree to a salary and more or less that's it. I haven't witnessed in my employment in British companies things like: training programs, investment in  skill-set, even with something inexpensive such as books, or any significant perks. Recently my job function changed without even communicating the changes with me in advance. One day I got to the office and I was told that I should be doing "*different things*". When complaining that this was not aligned with my initial job description or what was discussed in the interview, the response was that I was right, but that the company was "evolving". For me this was breach of contract, for my manager it was business as usual.

## Steve Blank versus Eric Ries

In the startup world they are both well known and respected. Steve Blank is known outside his business accomplishments for his books "(The four steps to epiphany)[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507 "The four steps to epiphany on Amazon"]" and the more recent "(Startup owners manual)[http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-By-Step/dp/0984999302/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y/278-6803900-2006242 "Startup owner's manual on Amazon"]". Eric Ries is also well known for his business accomplishments as well as his book (The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically Successful Businesses)[http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful/dp/0670921602/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_z/278-6803900-2006242 'Lean startup on Amazon']. A very convenient discovery was that Amazon.co.uk has grouped them together:

![Amazon.co.uk book grouping](/images/blank_and_ries_amazon_recommendation.png "Amazon.co.uk book grouping")

Well if we had to pick up who is more well known, the answer would probably be Steve Blank for a many reasons, such as being around for more years. My first surprise was that while discussing about startups, everybody seemed to know Ries, but almost nobody Blank. I now suspect that for some reason Ries became UK-popular, while for some other reason this did not happened with Blank, which is odd. Which brings us to the next section.

## Late pivots

One of the many concepts described in Ries "Lean startup" book and impresses me most is that of a "(pivot)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Pivot "Pivot definition Wikipedia"]" and I experienced a paradigm shift:

We were trying to raise capital for our then startup at about 2009. When saying that we had "pivoted", which we had, initially people were skeptic thinking that our initial planning was wrong hence the need for pivot. Some had suggested that we should not mention it but argue instead that our current direction was the initial one - a white lie. Later on, lean startup methodologies caught up. After that tipping point and acceptance, people kind of demanded us to have pivoted at least once as a sign that the company had gotten to the next level: They had some hypothesis, tested it, got the results and changed direction, so they've matured. 

There is nothing wrong with an idea getting traction and becoming part of the established paradigm, my thought was that since the idea was solidified across the Atlantic it would have crossed over instantly... why wait for a number of years? 

## Conclusions

### Euro-something

Summarization of my "Culture shocks" and their consequences materialized while finishing this post. It seemed to me that coming to UK, I would get to an alternative version of the States, while I landed into a great amazing European country, but nevertheless European. After years I made the decision to make it mine and live here, but the brain has still not fully recovered from the initial shock and partial disappointment.

Instead of embracing capitalism à-la Adam Smith by building products and services for the masses,  as it happened in the industrial revolution altering the global status quo (which UK dominated), we prefer to maintain the existing state of affairs (as discussed in "(Business Relationships)[/posts/2015-02-01-relationships]")... as you would expect from ego-centric Europeans.

Another realization was how much what we produce derives from our culture, origins and the society on which we were brought up. There was the false assumption that in purely technical disciples, things would be more abstract in a mathematical sense while also internationalized because of ... Internet. Maybe, reflecting on "(business relationships)[https://medium.com/@dimist/problematic-business-relationships-44dc00aeb05c "Business relationships medium"] - (business relationships)[/posts/2015-02-01-relationships "Business relationships - local copy"]"
the argument is best summarized in the following http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol quote:

"*What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, ...*"

the reason why US can make better software (which is same for everybody) and iPhones, even if the theoretical foundations have been laid here.
