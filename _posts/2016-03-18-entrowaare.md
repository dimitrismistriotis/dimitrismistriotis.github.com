# Entroware Review

Story so far:

Was a happy Apple consumer for the last 7 years (2 laptops, upgrades, some accessories). Wonderful customer service once I needed it. Decided not to get another one from them for  the following reasons:
* Repairability: Internal WiFi broke. Found out that (1) it is extremely rare and (2) difficult to fix. Repairability was not an issue in the past, but currenltly decided to keep laptops for as long as possible so immediatelly if became one.
* Closed systems and aggressive lock in. What I did not like from Microsoft in the 90s, Apple is forcing now (custom screws, screen sharing limited to apple TVs are two examples).
* Started getting fed up with the even changing charger adapters and having to spend lots of money for an adapter.
* The fact that you do not "own" the software but are licensed to use it (as I read it in the visualised terms and conditions here: http://itunestandc.tumblr.com/image/132727649660, here for more: http://itunestandc.tumblr.com/) was the last straw.
* Negating the arguments above, will keep the original machine so I will have an Apple computer should I need to use one, I'll switch on one I already have.

Another option championed by a hardware techie friend was to buy a cheap or a used Windows laptop and install my favourite Linux distribution on top with the added benefit of dual booting. I did not want to try this because (1) there are no compatibility gurantees and (2) there are battery/hibernation issues. The compatibilty argument (1) is a weak one because hardware is more or less supported these days, specially if not on the bleeding edge. There is the possibility though of something not working or not being supported well enough. The battery/hibernation (2) issues are more common. It seems that - although I am no expert on the subject - that hibernation and battery consumption is very difficult and not all hardware plays well with that. Having a laptop that needs charging every 2-3 hours, instead of saying 4-5 or more is something that costs electricity, strains the battery and beats the definition of having a laptop. For this reason the buy and install option was rejected. All these lead to a Linux specific vendor.

Additionally:
* I was willing to pay more for a linux first / linux friendly computer,
* Needed a thin laptop which I could sit with in a sofa or take with me in a trip,
* Preferred to buy from a UK firm if possible circulating as much money as I could within the country and also giving a kudo to the local people.

Other considerations:

System 76 was another consideration. Currently they ship to UK but was unsure of the case of having something stopped at customs. Maybe a partnership with a local dealer or something like Amazon would help?
Dell: no place where I could see their offering, so level was equal with Entroware.
Refurbish company: Very nice idea, might consider them if a local (UK) manifacturer was not available. The idea of fixing the BIOS is a very clever one.

## Let's hold our breath a bit

Took a bit too long to come. This is not a minus, I understood that a person assembled the laptop and then handled it over to someone else to install the software.
After I saw the email explaining the handover I remembered that entroware's site mentions that they ship within 5-7 business days not that the order is shipped or something.
To make the story short, the machine arrived after 13 days. I did not need it in now time so the waiting did not cause any disruption. In the meantime I compiled a migration list from my previous machine: https://gist.github.com/dimitrismistriotis/f7a84f724a173640b30a


Blame my English but what it meant was that the order bets to the shipping/parcel company within 5-7 days not to the delivery address. The delivery company now provided an refernce ID and a web address to check. Entroware ordered an "Express 48" service which indicates that they try to speed things up from their end loosing some money by purchasing the faster option. I thought "Express 48" meant 48 hours or 2 days. Parcel force send me then a text saying that the delivery would happen by the following 3 days (They got the parcel on 26th of February, they said I'd get it by 1st of March. Being in 2016 with 29 days the counter 48 hour counter start on the next working day).
I do not know how this would appeal to people accustomed to Amazon Prime and the current generation accustomed to want things to happen instantly. I want to keep the machine for an average of 3 years, so some extra days do not matter as I can still wotk with my existing one.
Gist of the situation is not to get a laptop from them if you need it in now-time, which was not the case for me: it took a while, but not a problem in my case.

Delivered on 1st of March. Which makes it order to door: 18/02/2016 to 01 13 days (2016 is a leap year). In the mean time I compiled a migration list: XXX and was eager to experience the machine.

Looking around on the internet was wandering which version of Ubuntu would be installed, what would the hardware experience be if I downgraded (it must be a version behind) to the latest elementaryOS. Because I have a spare laptop hard drive from a previous machine, I was also wandering how easy it would be to open the machine and swap hard drives. In my favourite now dead 2007 Macbook changing hard drive was untra easy. In my current 2011 model 15 screws need to be taken off and some of them are of a different type than others. Would Entroware's Apollo allow a hard drive swap in less than 5 minutes?

In the meantime I compiled a list of what needed to be moved along: https://gist.github.com/dimitrismistriotis/f7a84f724a173640b30a

I tried start using the laptop starting by migrating my files and configuring it from scratch (I do that in every new system so that
clutter will not survive between installations). After a week or so, I found myself organically having migrated most of my stuff,
using my Entroware laptop instead of my Macbook for all things Linux. Have not finished yet as my list still involves some copying.

At some point I forgot about writing this review post realised that I had immersed into an experience that was one step ahead from the desired
"it just works", it goes beyond doing a great job. After using it for a week as my main computer at home, I realised that Entroware's Apollo is the
laptop I always wanted to have and honestly never thought I would.
It supports a high screen resolution without flops, I can plug the HDMI cable to my TV monitor and see a video there (full screen). It is possible to fold it, move to 
a different room and then open it without everything stalling as hibernate works and it has a very good (maybe not perfect but nevertheless very good)
 battery autonomy. I found myself doing some Udacity classes followed by some word processing. I was holding the machine for some hours in my lap without
feeling the battery getting warmer and warmer which was my Macbook while running Linux experience. The chasis design is good without having
a large fruit glowing at the back and it switches on without a big TADAAA sound that needs hackery to become disabled. Bonus points: I know that if I want to upgrade it
I can unscrew the screws in the back and that's it.

The only thing that felt clunky was the trackpad experience. Initially it is configured to be both single and double button at the same time. It's top is acting as like trackpad, while the bottom does left and right clicks... Counterintuitive...
I found myseld using my mouse which was sitting in a drawer and I was ready to throw away.
I had this was solved on with elementaryOS so maybe I should wait a bit more or try to dig into Ubuntu's settings. Other users also did not like the
trackpad, so I am not alone here. Also some times hit clicked the pad accidentally while typing popping the pointer of the text to where the mouse pointer was.

Concluding we have a "yes". If you are a UK resident interested into having an open source software machine, go Entroware. As simple as that.

Some follow up thoughts:

Is it too late?

Probably. People have started shifting away from desktops, even laptops and the focus shifting towards the tablet for creative work and
mobile for consumption. Entroware might be in an ever declining market whose users would like to create content in a Surface4 or an iPad.
For what people like me that need to do web and general purpose programming with maybe some data wrangling or VMs/containers, it seems that most of
the stuff needed has already been ported to OS/X. Many people have migrated from Linux to OS/X probably without considering coming back. Maybe
the OS of choise for developers has shifted to OS/X creating an irreversable trend. Remember that recently I read that in some cases a Linux VM inside an 
OS/X host performs way better with regards to energy consumption a single Linux installation. Obviously it has to do with Apple's tight hardware/software
integration but nevertheless for many people OS/X is their day to day OS and Linux if needed is a VMWare/Vagrant/docker stone throw away.

The above opinion, that it might be too late for Linux even on the developer desktop is backed by StackOverflow's 2016 data (http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-desktop-operating-system). Specifically: *Last year, Mac edged ahead of the Linuxes as the number 2 operating system among developers. This year it became clear that trend is real. If OS adoption rates hold steady, by next year's survey fewer than 50% of developers may be using Windows.*

The hope of local computer manifacturers, that old but not forgotten Linux promise.

One promise of the open source movement that I had heard in the past is that by having a huge part of creating a general purpose computer - which is the OS -
taken care of, it would be easier for local manifacturers to address needs specific to their audience. In other words produce machines that US centric
manifacturers could not do or are not willing to. We have seen some attempts failing such FirefoxOS and some succeding such as the Rassberry Pi. Although few
have tried, Entroware's attempts somehow revive this "dream". Manifactured or at least assembled in UK, setup with a EN/GB keyboard distributed and delivered 
locally. Probably there is a better value proposition for desktop or servers that might need onsite support: what would be better for on-site support than
having the people that build the machines fixing them or at least having them one phone call away?

Things I would like to see:

Elementary OS and Recovery media. I got used to elementary, but want to see the latest Ubuntu first. I actually do not know (I tried to ask the Entroware's support) how to configure a machine from scratch, in case I ever want to change my hard drive for any reason. Up to now I am not sure if a plain Ubuntu USB stick and a "click install" is enough or if something else is needed. Maybe a guide on the company's blog would help. Would be good in case I wanted to try different distributions for a bit.

1 - 10 rank: 9 but I'm over excited. I waited a month before posting this just to see if the initial feeling would wear off but I'm still excited so 9.

Other options:

http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2016/03/dells-skylake-xps-13-precision-workstations-now-come-with-ubuntu-preinstalled/

I had investigated this option in the past. Generally I found Dell's Ubuntu laptops pricey. Did not like the fact that being a generally available and popular brand, there was no place where I could touch a machine lift it and get a feel of it. This levels the field compared to other companies a lot since you buy in both cases something that you
do not exactly know how it is unti you unbox it.
